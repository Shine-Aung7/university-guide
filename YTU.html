            <h1>History</h1>
       
          <p class="contaxt">Yangon Technological University began in 1924 as the Department of Engineering under University of Yangon. It was situated in downtown Yangon in the extended compound of Yangon General Hospital. There were only 2 lecturers and 17 students at the beginning. Civil Engineering was the only discipline at the time (until 1938).</br>
          In 1927, the Department was moved to the building known as the B.O.C. College of Engineering and Mining, which is about four miles north of the first place.</br>
         In 1938, a combined Mechanical and Electrical Engineering degree course was introduced.<br>
         After the war, in 1946, the Department was upgraded to become the Faculty of Engineering of University of Yangon.<br>
        [1954] Started offering four-year degree courses on Mining, Chemical, Metallurgy and Architecture disciplines.<br>
    [1955] Started offering a four-year Textile Engineering Degree.<br>

[1957] Started offering Water and Sanitation Engineering Degree, but was suspended in 1961 due to lack of students.<br>

[1958] The government spent 15 million kyats to build several buildings around BOC College including the famous Leik-Khone. 
Civil, Mechanical and Electrical Engineering classes were moved from BOC College to the new buildings.<br>

A project to build a new Engineering College in Gyogone, under Burmese-Soviet agreement, started in 1958, the project was completed in 1961.<br>

[1961] The Engineering Faculty was moved to Gyogone, Insein, about five miles north of the B.O.C. College and renamed to Burma Institute of Technology, BIT.<br>

[1964] The Burma Institute of Technology was renamed to Rangoon Institute of Technology, RIT. 
RIT became an independent Technological University under the new education system. 
It no longer was under the University of Yangon, and started offering Bachelor’s degree in Engineering and Architecture.<br>

[1990] The Rangoon Institute of Technology was renamed to Yangon Institute of Technology, YIT.<br>

[1991] The Mandalay Institute of Technology, MIT, was opened. YIT had to help out MIT in many ways.<br>

In January 1997, YIT was transferred from the Ministry of Education to the Ministry of Science and Technology. 
Ph.D. programs in engineering as well as in applied sciences were initiated in August 1997.<br>

In 1998, another technological university was established in Pyay, Pyay Institute of Technology, PIT. 
Inter-university linkage was established in May 1998 between YIT and Nanyang Technological University, NTU, in Singapore. 
On July 1, 1998, the name of the University was changed to Yangon Technological University, YTU. </p>
